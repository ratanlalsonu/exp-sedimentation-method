### Theory of Sedimentation Method for Particle Size Distribution Determination (Using the Andresen Pipette).
The sedimentation method is based on Stokes' Law, which describes the settling velocity of spherical particles in a fluid under gravity. The key principles are as follows:<br>

**1. Settling Velocity:**<br>
Particles settle at a velocity determined by their size, density, fluid viscosity, and the force of gravity. Larger particles settle faster than smaller ones.
The settling velocity (v) is given by:



                                                   v = [2(ρp-ρf)gr2]/9η
Where:<br>
v = settling velocity<br>
ρp =  particle density<br>
ρf = fluid density<br>
g = gravitational acceleration<br>
r = particle radius<br>
η = fluid viscosity<br>

**2. Depth and Time Relationship:**<br>
The depth of sampling and the time taken for particles to reach that depth are related to the particle size. Smaller particles take longer to settle, while larger ones reach the sampling depth quickly.<br>

**3. Particle Size Calculation:**<br>
By measuring the amount of sediment collected at specific intervals and depths, the particle size can be calculated using a rearranged form of Stokes' Law:

**4. Particle Size Distribution:**<br>
By analyzing the weight or concentration of sedimented particles over time, a particle size distribution can be determined. This distribution is often presented as a cumulative weight percentage versus particle size graph.<br>

**5. Assumptions:**<br>
1). Particles are spherical and settle independently without interference.<br>
2). The fluid is incompressible and has uniform viscosity.<br>
3). The system is free from external disturbances (e.g., vibrations).<br>

The sedimentation method is effective for determining the distribution of fine particles, typically in the size range of 2 µm to 50 µm.
