### Theory of Sedimentation Method for Particle Size Distribution Determination (Using the Andresen Pipette).
The sedimentation method is based on Stokes' Law, which describes the settling velocity of spherical particles in a fluid under gravity. The key principles are as follows:<br>
**1. Settling Velocity:**<br>
