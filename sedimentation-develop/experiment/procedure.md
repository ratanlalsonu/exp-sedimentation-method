#### **To determine the Particle size and Particle size distribution by using Sedimentation method (Andresen Pipette)**
<ul>

<h3>1. Prepare the sample by dispersing it in a suitable medium with a dispersing agent (if needed).</h6>


<h3>2. Pour the suspension into the Andreasen pipette cylinder up to the marked level.</h3>


<h3>3. Agitate the suspension to ensure uniform particle distribution.</h3>


<h3>4. Allow the particles to settle under gravity in a stable environment.

</h3>


<h3>5. Withdraw samples at a fixed depth at specific time intervals using the pipette.</h3>

<h3>6. Dry and weigh the collected samples to determine the sedimented material.</h3>
<h3>7. Calculate particle size using Stokesâ€™ Law and determine the particle size distribution.</h3>
<h3>8. Clean the apparatus thoroughly after completing the experiment.</h3>
</ul>
